# Smart-Gate-System
The Smart Gate System is an automated access control solution designed to improve security and convenience. It uses embedded hardware and sensors to allow or restrict entry based on user authentication. The system reduces manual effort, enhances safety, and ensures controlled access in places like campuses, apartments, offices, and parking areas.

##  Technologies Used
* Microcontroller
* Sensors
* Embedded C / C++
* Tinkercad

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

| S.No | Component Name          | Specification / Description       |  Quantity |
| ---: | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | :-------: |
|    1 | Microcontroller         | Arduino Uno                       |     1     |
|    2 | IR Sensor               | Object detection / Authentication |     1     |
|    3 | Servo Motor             | Gate movement control             |     1     |

##  Working of Smart Gate System
1. The system continuously monitors the sensor input.
2. When a person or vehicle approaches, the sensor detects it.
3. The microcontroller processes the sensor signal.
4. If access is authorized, the controller sends a signal to the motor.
5. The motor opens the gate automatically.
6. After a preset delay, the gate closes automatically.

This process ensures **secure, automatic, and contactless gate operation**.
